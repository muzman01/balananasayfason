    <h3>4. Use of Service</h3><br>
    <p>
      <strong>4.1 Process of Service</strong><br> <br> <br>
      (1) On the Earn page, you may choose the
  currency of the cryptocurrencies you intend to
  invest in. Different Third Party DeFi Platform
  may be supported for investment for different
  currency of the cryptocurrencies. Users can
  deposit certain cryptocurrencies through different
  Third Party DeFi Platform Each time a user
  deposits cryptocurrencies, an order will be
  generated. BALANCE NETWORK will transfer
  the cryptocurrencies under all orders accumulated
  from T time of the previous day to T time of the
  current day to the corresponding Third Party DeFi
  Platform at a time each day. After the User
  successfully places an order, the principal will be
  transferred from the User’s Funding Account to
  the Finance Account, and the estimate interests (if
  applicable) and rewards (if applicable) accrued
  will be displayed and updated in the Funding
  Account. The Users can view the interests and
  rewards accrued each day in the Earn order
  management tool in the account. But the Users
  cannot withdraw such interests and rewards. The
  interest will only be distributed and deposited to
  the User's Funding Account after the User's order
  is successfully redeemed. The rewards will be
  distributed to your Funding Account each day.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      (2) You understand and agree that in relation to
  the Uniswap Platform, Pancakeswap Platform or
  Sushiswap Platform, due to market fluctuations,
  the ratio of the currency pair when the User place
  an order may be different from the ratio of the
  currency pair when the User’s cryptocurrencies
  invested are successfully transferred on chain on
  the Uniswap Platform, Pancakeswap Platform or
  Sushiswap Platform. The ratio of the currency pair
  shall be determined based on the ratio when the
  User’s cryptocurrencies invested are successfully
  transferred on chain on the Uniswap Platform,
  Pancakeswap Platform or Sushiswap Platform.
  The excessive cryptocurrencies will be deposited
  into the User’s account. In order to ensure User’s
  benefits, if the slippage exceeds the preset
  maximum slippage when the User’s
  cryptocurrencies invested are successfully
  transferred on chain on the Uniswap Platform,
  Pancakeswap Platform or Sushiswap Platform,
  BALANCE NETWORK will cancel all the
  transaction orders requested in relation to the
  Uniswap Platform, Pancakeswap Platform or
  Sushiswap Platform under this Service on that day
  and refund all the investment of the Users.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      (3) The investment under this Service is current, and
  Users may redeem at any time. After the User place a
  redemption operation instruction on the Earn
  product, BALANCE NETWORK will redeem all
  orders accumulated from T1 on the previous day to
  T1 on the current day from Ethereum chain or other
  chains of the corresponding Third Party DeFi
  Platform at certain time each day. BALANCE
  NETWORK will calculate the interests and rewards
  which a User could earn pro rata based on the
  proportion of a user’s investment, and will distribute
  and deposit the interests into User’s Funding
  Account, and transfer the principal frozen in your
  Finance Account to User’s Funding Account. The
  rewards will be distributed to your Funding Account
  each day.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    <strong>4.2  On-Chain Transfer and redemption Time</strong> <br> <br>
    (1) If you deposited on BALANCE NETWORK
  pool will transfer the cryptocurrencies deposited
  by Users to the Ethereum chain or other chains of
  the Third Party DeFi Platform at 12:00 a.m.
  (UTC) each day. Specifically, for the
  cryptocurrencies under all orders accumulated
  from 12:00 a.m. (UTC) of the previous day to
  12:00 a.m. (UTC) of the current day, BALANCE
  NETWORK will transfer all the cryptocurrencies
  invested by all Users to the Ethereum chain or
  other chains of the Third Party DeFi Platform at
  12:00 a.m. (UTC) that day. The funds invested by
  the User will only begin to accrue interests after
  the on-chain transfer operation is completed
  successfully. If the User completes the order after
  12: 00 a.m. (UTC), the actual on chain time of the
  User’s funds will be around 12:00 a.m. (UTC) of
  the next day, and the actual time to start to accrue
  interest on the cryptocurrencies will be the time
  when the funds are actually transferred to the
  Ethereum chain of the Third Party DeFi Platform
  successfully the next day.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    (2) The redemption time will be similar to the onchain time. BALANCE NETWORK will redeem
  all the orders from the chain collectively at 12:00
  a.m. (UTC) each day for all the redemption orders
  accumulated from 12:00 a.m. (UTC) of the
  previous day to 12: 00 a.m. (UTC) of the current
  day.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    <strong>4.3 Return of principal and interests and
  distribution of rewards</strong> <br><br>
  After the User redeems the order, after
  BALANCE NETWORK redeems collectively
  from the chains at the daily fixed on-chains time
  or redemption time set out in Clause 4.2 above,
  the User’s principal frozen will be released and
  transfer from the Finance Account to the Funding
  Account. At the same time, BALANCE
  NETWORK will distribute the User's interests and
  rewards pro rata based on the User's investment
  proportion and deposit to the User's Funding
  Account. <br>
  (1) In relation of the Uniswap Platform, Pancake
  Platform and Sushiswap Platform or other thirdparty platforms:
  <ul class="ul-list-color">
    <li>You understand and agree that the Uniswap
  Platform or Sushiswap Platform will transfer the
  cryptocurrencies under the currency pair you
  invested to the liquidity pool (AMM-Automated
  Market Maker). With market transactions and
  price fluctuations, the redemption amount and the
  amount of assets invested under your order will be
  inconsistent.</li>
    <li>You understand and agree that the decrease in
  overall value as result of price fluctuations in the
  liquidity pool is called impermanence loss. When
  you conduct the Uniswap Platform, Pancake
  Platform or Sushiswap Platform mining, your
  investment will be subject to impermanent losses.
  BALANCE NETWORK shall not be liable for
  any compensation or other legal liabilities for such
  impermanent losses you may suffer as a result of
  the above circumstances.</li>
