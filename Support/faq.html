    <summary>What is Blockchain?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>                
        Blockchain is like an online ledger. Blockchain software is 
        a digital ledger that can be used to track all kinds of data. 
        This software can track the flow of goods, movements of money, 
        who owns works of art or poetry, among many other things.
        Blockchain technology can be used in many areas from health to 
        transportation, from sports to art, 
        from approval processes to voting. Blockchains are distinguished 
        by their ability to immutably store information; that is, information 
        cannot be changed or hacked. The primary function of every blockchain is
        to group digital information into immutable collections called “blocks”. 
        When a block is filled with data, a very complex process is performed before 
        it becomes a permanent record. Each block is linked to the next block with a 
        code that references the contents of both blocks. That's why it's called a "chain". 
        Anyone who joins a blockchain using their computer is considered a "node" in the blockchain. 
        There can be thousands or even millions of nodes in a chain. The main achievement of the design 
        is that the blockchain multiplies and is constantly updated with each of these nodes. Blockchains 
        provide a high degree of privacy as well as transparency. The identity of a person (or machine) using 
        a blockchain is hidden behind a string of code. Unless this person reveals his identity himself, 
        it cannot be known who he is. However, transactions made by this identity are transparent. 
        Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most popular blockchain networks. Ethereum is seen on the higher 
        end with its smart contract feature. The most well-known product of blockchain technology is 
        cryptocurrencies. According to the report by Credit Suisse, blockchain; It is currently in a period 
        when it is starting to rise as a mainstream. It is expected to be fully accepted and used in every 
        field where it can be adapted in the coming periods.</p>

    <summary>How to input your data on this board?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>
        A token is a unit of value in an existing blockchain. Tokens do not have their own blockchain, 
        they are dependent on the blockchain of an existing cryptocurrency. Since tokens have a unit value, 
        this value can be traded. Value, coins, points, certificates, in-game items, etc. may be in shape. 
        Tokens are often used to raise funds in an ICO (“Initial Coin Offering” or IPO (“Initial Public Offering”) 
        that can be compared to an IPO of listed companies. In the case of an ICO, companies can go public on the 
        blockchain. Just as you buy shares in a company in an IPO, ICO or Token Crowdsale, the tokens you buy can be 
        used to represent a share in the company or you may have voting rights for decision making. This is why tokens 
        are also called crypto assets or crypto assets and crypto equities. The major difference between a cryptocurrency 
        and a token is that cryptocurrencies have their own blockchain, on the other hand, tokens are built on a blockchain 
        like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Waves, BSC, which facilitates the creation of decentralized applications. A token is a form 
        of money that represents a greater value than its intrinsic value. Initially, banks issued coins worth their weight 
        in gold or other precious metals, but banks soon began issuing coin coins such as notes or coins that they could 
        guarantee would be worth a certain amount of precious metal. The token is based on a bank's guarantee or backing of 
        notes or coins and is based on government laws or regulations. In some cases, the token coin may fall in value due 
        to inflation or the government printing too much money.

    <summary>What is Altcoin?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
        <p>                    
        Altcoin is not the name of a cryptocurrency. Rather, the term 
        "altcoin" is used to refer to any alternative cryptocurrency 
        to Bitcoin. For example, BNB, Solana, and Ether are technically 
        altcoins. Having stated this, crypto players often use the term 
        altcoin to describe cryptocurrencies with low market caps. Altcoins 
        can differ from Bitcoin in several ways. Some have a different 
        economic model or a different method of distribution of money, 
        such as altcoins issued to all citizens of a country. Some altcoins 
        offer a more versatile programming language for building apps, while 
        others offer more privacy compared to Bitcoin. There are also altcoins 
        that serve very specific, non-monetary use cases such as domain, registry, 
        or data storage tokens. However, there may be altcoins whose fundamental 
        and technical infrastructure is not functional. For this reason, it is necessary 
        to examine the project, basic and technical infrastructure, performance, total 
        transaction volume for an altcoin.

    <summary>What is Stablecoin?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>
        A stablecoin is a new type of cryptocurrency, 
        usually pegged to another fiat currency or
        valuable asset. These coins can be pegged to 
        fiat currencies such as the US dollar, other 
        cryptocurrencies, precious metals, or a combination 
        of the three. One of the most well-known stablecoins 
        is Tether (USDT), which was created with its value 
        envisioned to be equivalent to the US dollar. Stablecoins 
        are designed and collateralized to counteract the natural 
        price volatility seen in cryptocurrency prices; meaning that 
        the total number of stable currencies in circulation is backed 
        by assets held in reserve. Simply put, if there is 1,000 USD 
        pegged money in circulation, there must be at least $1,000 in a bank. 
        Suffering from Bitcoin's extreme ups and downs, its proponents believe 
        stablecoins are removing the view of cryptocurrencies as an unstable 
        investment vehicle. Thus, stablecoins make cryptocurrencies more useful 
        for purchasing goods and services.

        NFT are tokens created with cryptographic software that add the value of 
        'uniqueness'. It stands for non-fungible token. It can be defined as the 
        certificate of the product it represents. Each NFT is unique. They have 
        special digital signatures that make it impossible to interchange or equal 
        one another. For this reason, it is also easy to access and verify.

    <summary>What is Whitepaper?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>
        A “White Paper” is an informational document usually published by a 
        company or nonprofit organization to promote or highlight the technical 
        aspects of a solution, product, or service. “White papers” are often written
         as sales and marketing documents used to persuade potential customers to learn 
         more about or purchase a particular product, service, technology or methodology. 
         For example, Satoshi Nakamato announced Bitcoin by publishing a white paper. “White paper” 
         is intended to be used as a pre-sales marketing tool and not as a user manual or other technical 
         document developed to support the user after a purchase. “White paper” is currently used commercially 
         as a document for marketing and sales. They also stand out in the technology space to discuss potential 
         uses of a new product and how it can help improve the efficiency of processes in companies. In particular, 
         every Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in the cryptocurrency market needs a white paper to run a successful campaign. 
         In this context, “white paper” is an important document that describes the outline of a problem that the project 
         wants to solve, its solution, a detailed description of its products, its architecture, and how it will interact with users.

    <summary>What is a Private Key?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>                    
        In cryptocurrency trading, a public address is created and given a private key to a user to send and receive cryptocurrencies. 
        The public address is where cryptocurrencies are deposited and received. However, even if a user has tokens in his address, 
        he cannot withdraw them without the unique private key. The public key is generated from the private key through a complex 
        mathematical algorithm. However, it is nearly impossible to reverse the process by generating a private key from a public key. 
        The private key can take several different forms, often depicted as a series of alphanumeric characters, making a hacker's job difficult. 
        You can think of the public address as a mailbox and the private key as the key to the box. The postman and anyone else can drop a 
        letter into the open mouth of the mailbox. However, only the person with the unique-private key is the only person who can retrieve 
        the contents of the mailbox. Therefore, it is extremely important to keep the key safe, otherwise it may be stolen and the mailbox 
        may be compromised. The digital wallet can store the user's private key. When a transaction is initiated, the wallet software processes 
        the transaction with the private key, creating a digital signature. This is a fairly secure method as the only way to create a valid 
        signature for any transaction is to use the private key. If a user loses their private key, they can no longer access their wallet to 
        spend, withdraw or transfer their cryptocurrencies. Therefore, it is imperative to save the private key in a safe place. There are several 
        different ways to store a digital wallet containing a private key. Private keys can be stored in paper wallets, which are documents printed 
        with the private key and QR code; so that when a transaction needs to be signed it can be easily scanned. Private keys can also be stored 
        using a hardware wallet that uses smart cards or USB devices to generate and secure offline private keys.
        An offline software wallet can also be used to store private keys. This wallet has an offline section for private keys and an online 
        section where public keys are stored. With an offline software wallet, a new transaction is moved offline to be digitally signed and 
        then moved back online for publication on the cryptocurrency network.

    <summary>What is a Public Key?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>
        A public key is a type of encryption code that makes it possible to transfer cryptocurrencies to the user's account. 
        The public key along with the private key are essential tools to secure the crypto economy. When a user initiates their 
        first transaction with Bitcoin or altcoins, a unique public key and private key pair are generated. Each of the keys is
         a long string of alphanumeric characters that helps keep the user's assets secure in the digital ecosystem. The private 
         key is known only to the user and acts as the user's digital identity. The private key authorizes the user to take, 
         withdraw, transfer or perform another action from his account. A complex algorithm is applied to the private key to 
         generate the public key, and both keys are stored in a digital wallet. The signature of the private key proves the ownership 
         of the private key. Since the public key is created using the private key, the user's public key is used to prove that the 
         digital signature comes from his private key. After the transaction is verified as valid, the amount to be transferred will 
         be sent to the recipient's public address. The public address is a hashed version of the public key. Because the public key 
         consists of an extremely long string of numbers, it is compressed and truncated to form the public address. In reality, the 
         private key creates the public key, which creates the public address. After two people reach an agreement for a cryptocurrency 
         transfer, they show each other their public addresses. A public address is like a bank account number. The sender needs this 
         number in order to send the money to the recipient. Thus, the recipient can then spend or withdraw the crypto money sent with 
         their private key.

    <summary>What is Airdrop?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>In the world of crypto money, “airdrop” is the distribution of newly produced cryptocurrencies to existing holders of 
          cryptocurrencies at a certain rate for the purpose of rewarding. You can think of the airdrop system as a way of advertising 
          the products that will be released on the market or as a promotional application. There is a possibility that the products 
          will not sell despite the advertisements, and there is a possibility that the cryptocurrencies will not be able to enter the 
          cryptocurrency exchanges despite the airdrop. However, using this system is an attractive option for new cryptocurrency creators. 
          Periodically, cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet service providers, etc. Blockchain-based services like these want to reward their 
          customers and subscribers. Airdrop can be used as a means of rewarding loyal customers with cryptocurrencies without any fees. 
          This system acts as a kind of incentive to ensure continuity on such platforms. Airdrop is analogous to rewards (bonus points, etc.) 
          and discount gifts from companies that do not use blockchain technology in the mainstream commerce world.

    <summary>What is a Smart Contract?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>
        A smart contract or smart contract is a type of contract between the buyer and the seller that works by writing the contract directly 
        into the lines of code. The code and contracts here are distributed; It is located on a decentralized blockchain network. 
        The code controls execution; Transactions are traceable and irreversible. Smart contracts do not require a central authority, 
        legal system or external enforcement mechanism; It allows for trusted transactions and deals to be made between separate, anonymous parties.
        While blockchain technology is primarily thought of as the foundation of Bitcoin, it has gone far beyond supporting virtual 
        currency. Smart contracts were first proposed in 1994 by American computer scientist Nick Szabo, who invented a virtual currency 
        called "Bit Gold" in 1998, exactly 10 years before the invention of Bitcoin. There are also rumors that Szabo is actually the 
        real Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous inventor of Bitcoin. However, we do not have precise information on this issue. Szabo 
        defined smart contracts as software transaction protocols that execute the terms of the contract. He wanted to extend the 
        unctionality of electronic transaction methods such as he pos (point of sale) into the digital realm. Szabo also proposed 
        a contract for synthetic assets such as derivatives and bonds. The term “smart contract” is somewhat unfortunate; because 
        how smart are smart contracts; nor should it be confused with a legal contract: A smart contract can only be as smart as 
        the people who code it. All information available at the time of coding; While smart contracts have the potential to enforce 
        legal contracts if certain conditions are met, we still need to solve a large number of tech-legal problems that require 
        interdisciplinary discourse.
        It is likely that we will see legal contracts and smart contracts converge as technology becomes more mature, pervasive, 
        and legal standards are adopted.

    <summary>What is a Hard Cap?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>
          Hard cap is a term used for the maximum level of the targeted investment amount in the ICO process. It is translated 
          into our language as an upper limit. When the hard cap target is reached, the investment process stops and the ICO 
          process is completed. For the efficiency of the project in question, it is of great importance to determine the hard 
          cap level well and to reach it in a short time. If the desired goal is not achieved in the ICO process, the project 
          will not be realized and the investors will be paid back. Likewise, if an amount above the hard cap level is reached, 
          the excess investments are also refunded. Otherwise, the owner or owners of the project fall into an insecure position 
          and a red flag occurs on the part of the investors. Hard cap is of great importance in order to create a safe and advancing 
          project. Realizing the target and making proper practices in line with the developments experienced creates a safe image 
          for the project in question.

    <summary>What is a Cold - Hot Wallet?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
    <p>
        There are two ways to store data in digital media: Cold and hot storage. Hot wallet is used for easily accessible data; 
        It is a fast and expensive type of storage. Cold wallet, on the other hand, is more economical and is a type of offline 
        storage used for data that does not need continuous use. E.g; Storing files and data through various cloud applications 
        is a storage method. Cloud systems can offer hot or cold services as needed. In which cases cold storage and in which 
        cases hot storage will be preferred actually determines the data itself. All data that needs to be accessed continuously 
        and that can be shared when necessary should be stored with hot storage method. By storing visual or written files in 
        Google-based storage systems; The best example of this is to be able to download it quickly when necessary, to make various 
        additions or changes on it, and even to share it. It may take minutes or even hours to access data or files stored with the 
        cold storage method. Sometimes the data can be made independent from the internet by storing it in the disk. With this method; 
        “Still data” that does not need to be used actively, whose need is questioned, or which does not have time to be used even if 
        it is important can be stored. In the blockchain ecosystem, wallets store crypto assets. There are two types of wallets, hot 
        and cold. Crypto assets with constant investment movement can be kept safe with the hot storage method. In this way, the person 
        can transact with his assets whenever he wishes. In addition to using hot wallets, holding assets on cryptocurrency exchanges is 
        also a method. Assets that are not planned to have an investment circulation can be safely kept in a cold wallet. Since there is 
        no need for internet access in this method, the possibility of being affected by cyber attacks is also minimized. Access can only 
        be achieved by logging in with the specified password and that password should not be shared with third parties.

    <summary>What is AML?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>LAnti-money laundering (Anti Money Laundering or AML) refers to a set of laws, regulations and procedures aimed at 
          preventing criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. While anti-money laundering laws 
          cover a relatively limited number of transactions and criminal acts, their consequences are far-reaching. AML regulations 
          are meant to ensure that banks and other financial institutions that issue loans or allow customers to open deposit accounts
           do not aid in money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws and regulations include criminal activities such as market manipulation, 
           illegal trade in goods, corruption of public funds and tax evasion; It targets the methods used to hide these crimes and the money 
           obtained from them. Criminals often strive to “launder” money they have obtained illegally through activities such as drug trafficking. 
           One of the most common techniques is to run the money through a legitimate, cash-based business owned by a criminal organization or 
           confederation. Money launderers can deposit cash in smaller increments that are unlikely to raise suspicion or be used to purchase 
           other cash instruments. Or they deposit money using dishonest brokers who want to ignore the rules in exchange for large commissions. 
           However, the AML holding period is enshrined in a rule that requires deposits to remain in an account for at least five trading days. 
           This holding period is aimed at combating money laundering and assisting in risk management.</p>

        Arbitrage; It is the act of making your investment on the lowest market by comparing the values of the asset you want to 
        invest in different markets and making a profit. The practice of arbitrage involves buying and reselling assets for profit. 
        In other words, it means taking advantage of the price difference between multiple markets. The term is most commonly applied 
        to financial investment trading of assets such as bonds, stocks and derivatives. But it can also be applied to any situation 
        that can match deals that take advantage of unstable market prices. Arbitrage is the result of market inefficiencies and helps 
        ensure that prices do not deviate significantly from fair market values over an extended period of time. Persons or businesses 
        dealing with arbitrage are called arbitrageurs. Arbitrages are usually banks or brokerage firms, but may also be other companies

    <summary>What is a Bear Season?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>Bear season, or bear market, is when the market experiences prolonged price drops. It is often used to refer to 
          situations where security prices have dropped 20% or more from recent highs due to widespread pessimism and 
          negative investor sentiment. Bear seasons are often associated with dips in an overall market or index, such as the 
          S&P 500; however, individual securities may be considered acceptable during a bear season if they are down 20% or 
          more over an extended period of time. Although there is no general opinion about how long the bear season will last, 
          it is expected that prices will continue to decrease for a long time. Demand for products in a bear market is decreasing. 
          Since the demand has decreased, nobody wants to buy those products and the prices continue to fall. The causes of a bear 
          market often vary, but in general, a weak, slowing or stagnant economy will bring with it a bear market. Signs of a weak 
          or slowing economy are often hidden in low employment, low disposable income, weak productivity and business profits. Also, 
          any government intervention in the economy can trigger a bear market. For example, changes in the tax rate or interest rates 
          can lead to a bear market. Similarly, a drop in investor confidence could signal the beginning of a bear market. Investors will 
          act when they believe something will happen; in which case they sell shares to avoid losses.</p>

    <summary>What is a Bull Season?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>
        A bull season or bull market is used to describe a financial market in which prices are rising or expected to rise. 
        It is assumed that the origin of this term comes from the belief that bulls lift everything from below with their horns. 
        The term “bull market” is often used to refer to the stock market; but it can be applied to anything bought and sold like 
        bonds, real estate, currencies and commodities. Because the prices of securities are constantly rising and falling during 
        trading, the term "bull market" is usually reserved for long periods during which a large part of the security's price rises. 
        Bull markets can last for months or even years. Bull markets have optimism, investor confidence, and expectations that positive 
        results should last for a long time. It is difficult to constantly predict when trends in the market may change. Part of the 
        difficulty is that psychological influences and speculation can sometimes play a big role in markets. There is no specific and 
        universal metric used to describe a bull market. However, technically it is expected to have risen 20% from the relevant market 
        low. Because bull markets are difficult to predict, analysts can usually only recognize this phenomenon after the event. 
        A notable bull market in recent history is the period from 2003-2007. During this time, the S&P 500 increased significantly 
        after the previous decline; When the 2008 financial crisis hit, after the bull market, there were big drops again. Bull markets 
        usually happen when the economy is strengthening or already strong. They tend to parallel strong gross domestic product and declines 
        in unemployment and often coincide with increases in corporate profits. Investor confidence will also tend to climb during the bull market. 
        The overall stock demand and the overall tone of the market will be positive. There will also be an overall increase in the amount of 
        IPO activity during bull markets.

        Decentralized autonomous organization ie DAO; As its name suggests, it is a system that is managed by computer codes 
        without being dependent on any authority. DASH is also the token of this system. The most important feature of cryptocurrencies; 
        their existence in a decentralized manner and without being dependent on any authority. DAO is a decentralized crypto finance model 
        that has decentralized details and started to be established after the emergence of Bitcoin.

    <summary>What is ERC-20</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>                
        ERC-20; It is the general definition of the standards applied for the tokens existing on the Ethereum platform to 
        become functional. ERC; It stands for “Ethereum Request For Comments”, 20 is the ID number that customizes it.
        ERC-20 standards are divided into two groups as mandatory and optional. All tokens on the Ethereum network that are
         expected to become functional must meet the mandatory standards. Mandatory standards are the source of smart contracts.
          Developers must own an equal number of the Ethereum network token in question, and when this balance is balanced, the 
          transfer process kicks in. The existence and number of the currency to be transferred is controlled through smart contracts. 
          In order to transfer between two users, the so-called transfer form system is activated. When all conditions are suitable, 
          the requested transaction is implemented.
        ERC-20 is a system that only works on the Ethereum network and does not function on other networks. It aims to create an easier, 
        faster and safer investment ecosystem. Since there is a uniform technology, the tokens included in the platform are easier to 
        trace and have the effect of increasing the speed of transactions. When a new token is introduced in different systems, the whole 
        layout has to be re-adapted and transactions take a long time. Since ERC-20 has set its standards to eliminate this, the tokens 
        included in the ecosystem adapt easily and start working quickly.</p>

    <summary>What is P2P (Peer to Peer)?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>                
        P2P or “peer to peer” is used to describe the exchange or sharing of information, data or assets between parties 
        without the involvement of a central authority. Peer-to-peer, or P2P, takes a distributed approach to interactions 
        between individuals and groups. This approach is used in computers and networks (peer-to-peer file sharing) and 
        cryptocurrency trading. In a digital peer-to-peer network, each user is (theoretically) an owner and partner of the 
        network. This type of network can be used for almost any information or file sharing process. For example, one of the 
        first mass uses of P2P networks was Napster's file sharing service. In the context of currencies, P2P refers to the 
        exchange of currencies that is not established by a central banking authority. A particularly common application is made 
        possible by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Virtual currencies are transferred electronically between parties. Peer-to-peer 
        exchanges allow individuals to move currencies from their account to someone else's without the need to go to a financial 
        institution. P2P networks rely on digital transmissions, which in turn depend on the availability of the internet connection.

    <summary>What is Soft Cap?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>                
        Soft Cap is the amount of capital raised to the extent that a project will be considered successful. In other words, 
        it is the minimum amount of funds needed to keep the project going as planned. Most of the projects realized today can 
        easily reach the soft cap level. One of the biggest reasons for this is that you can do an ICO right now when you start 
        a project and want to raise capital. Reaching the soft cap level is not guaranteed by projects. This level is mainly 
        speculative in nature. If the soft cap level is not reached, most of the projects are closed and all earned capital is 
        returned to the investors. If the project does not end, then it enters the hard cap mode. Therefore, it is very important 
        for investors to base the soft cap and hard cap levels on real plans. For example, transparent projects are the projects that 
        give the most confidence to the society and investors.

    <summary>What is KYC?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>                
        Know Your Customer, or KYC, is a procedure that allows investment advisors to have detailed information about their 
        clients' risk tolerance, investment information and financial standing. KYC compliance typically includes requirements 
        and policies such as risk management, client acceptance policies, and transaction monitoring. The KYC rule is very important 
        at the start of a client-broker relationship to assess each client's overall financial situation before making any recommendations. 
        Investment advisors and securities firms are responsible for knowing each client's financial situation by discovering and collecting 
        the client's age, other investments, tax status, financial needs, investment experience, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance.
        The principles of digital identity are: high privacy, trust, accessibility, user orientation, usability, auditability, portability, flexibility, 
        permanence and transparency. Thanks to these features, it can be used safely in many areas such as official transactions, social media accounts, 
        digital banking, digital shopping. Blockchain technology is of great importance to keep digital identity security at a high level. Since no 
        information existing in this ecosystem can be changed; It is possible for digital identity and digital signature information to be stored securely 
        and to have an easy operation. The application of this technology to strengthen the infrastructure of the digital identity product and their work 
        in harmony are among the promising issues.

    <summary>What is Decentralization?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>                
        “Decentralization” or “decentralization” is the name given to the process of transforming the power of a central authority 
        into a decentralized one. Most financial and government systems currently in existence are centralized. For example, in many 
        countries, there is a central bank in the position of authority that oversees the financial system. Over the years, some of the 
        drawbacks of centralization have emerged; Some very important decisions taken intentionally or unconsciously can cause the entire 
        world economic system to be paralyzed. Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto as an alternative to central governments' fiat currencies. 
        The fact that it allows sending and receiving money and trading independently of any central authority makes it much more flexible and 
        democratic than traditional currencies. The blockchain technology that spawned Bitcoin is what allows for this decentralization. Because 
        it offers every user the opportunity to become one of the network's many payment processors. Many cryptocurrencies have emerged since the
         emergence of Bitcoin. These currencies likewise adopted a decentralized management model and used blockchain technology.

    <summary>What is Mnemonic Phrase?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>                
        Mnemonic phrase is a memory aid method applied to remember a forgotten information. Using an abbreviation, phrase, song or 
        rhyme as a clue to remind you when something is forgotten. During mail password creation, a photo or word that will help remind 
        you in case you forget the password is a good example for a mnemonic phrase. In this way, when the password is forgotten, the 
        password can be remembered with the secret question or secret photo option. The use of mnemonic phrases in blockchain is only 
        seen in crypto wallets. Crypto wallets are usually accessed with passwords consisting of a minimum of 12-character phrases. If
         this password is forgotten, it is not possible to obtain a new password. Therefore, the password must be stored securely. Instead 
         of storing the password directly, an evocative expression can be created. A sentence can be written with words consisting of clues 
         that will remind you of the password. These clues should be known only to the password owner and cannot be deciphered by anyone else.
          Otherwise, cryptocurrencies in the wallet can be stolen. Except for forgetting the password, the computer where the wallet is stored can be 
          corrupted, stolen or lost. In this case, again, the mnemonic phrase is needed to save the wallet. Thanks to the created mnemonic sentences, 
          the wallet can be saved. In the Ethereum ecosystem, the mnemonic phrase is usually created in accordance with the BIP 32 specification. 
          Well; The mnemonic phrase is created with 24 randomly selected words from the BIP 32 English word list. Sometimes this number of words 
          can be limited to 12 for easier recall.

        Each crypto money should be deposited to its own wallet address and attention should be paid to which network the sendings 
        are made over. To transfer ETH, LINK, HOT, BAT, CHZ from a different platform or personal wallet, deposit wallet addresses defined 
        in your account must be used. These transfers take place over the ERC-20 network. To make an ERC-20 based USDT deposit, the ETH wallet 
        address defined in your account must be used. Transfers made in this way take place over the ERC-20 network. To make an Omni-based USDT 
        deposit, the USDT wallet address defined in your account must be used. Transfers made in this way take place over the Omni network. The 
        completion and reflection of crypto money transfers on user accounts is not connected with Balance Network. It is technically not possible

    <summary>How is Arbitrage Done?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>                
        Since the purpose of arbitrage is to make a risk-free profit by taking advantage of the arbitrage opportunity 
        created by price differences, the relevant asset must be simultaneously purchased from one market and sold in another market, 
        and these transactions must be completed in a very short time, as soon as the arbitrage opportunity occurs. Otherwise, the price 
        inequality will be noticed by other players in the market and prices will be fixed in a short time. Significant advances in technology, 
        especially when it comes to computerized selling and trading systems, pricing errors in the market have made it very difficult to profit 
        from arbitrage. Some companies have automatic monitors to monitor the price fluctuations of financial instruments and products. 
        On the other hand, it may be possible to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities that may arise, especially when volatility increases, 
        without resorting to special software.

        In Balance Network, a digital asset trading platform where buyers and sellers meet, all trading orders belong to users. 
        Cryptocurrency prices are formed automatically according to the supply and demand situation of the users. In the Balance 
        Network, the savings of all the transactions on the balances of the users belong to them, so the prices are formed automatically. 
        It is structurally impossible to find any external influences other than user orientations. Since each digital asset trading platform 
        has different features such as internal dynamics, user audience, trading volume and number of pending orders, some price differences may
         appear between platforms instantly. The speed and content of the reaction of user groups that make purchases and sales on different 
         platforms to local and global developments can be different. These reactions can reveal price differences on cryptocurrency platforms. 
         There is no outside influence on reliable digital asset trading platforms, and prices are only formed by user trends.

    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>                
        Conditional order, also known as stop-loss, is the type of order that is activated when the conditions you specify 
        regarding prices are fulfilled. By using the feature in the Exchage application, you can ensure that your order is 
        forwarded to the trading board when the condition you set is met. By using the conditional order feature, you can 
        prepare your own orders and make them active when conditions occur. Although the price touches your condition price, 
        the market may move in the opposite direction again before it's your turn. In such cases, although the condition may 
        seem to have occurred for a moment, your order may not be fulfilled because the price turns in the opposite direction
         before it is your turn. Leaving some margin between the condition price and the order price increases the probability 
         of your order being executed.

        Bitcoin wallets hold a secret piece of data called a private key or seed used to sign transactions and provide mathematical 
        proof that it comes from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being modified by anyone after 
        the transaction has been made. All transactions are broadcast on the network and are confirmed within 1-5 minutes, usually through 
        a process called mining.

                There are two ways to store data in digital media: Cold and hot  storage. Hot wallet is used for easily accessible data; It is a fast and expensive type of storage. Cold wallet, on the other hand, is more economical and is a type of offline storage used for data that does not need continuous use. E.g; Storing files and data through various cloud applications is a storage method. Cloud systems can offer hot or cold services as needed. In which cases cold storage and in which cases hot storage will be preferred actually determines the data itself. All data that needs to be accessed continuously and that can be shared when necessary should be stored with hot storage method. By storing visual or written files in Google-based storage systems; The best example of this is to be able to download it quickly when necessary, to make various additions or changes on it, and even to share it. It may take minutes or even hours to access data or files stored with the cold storage method. Sometimes the data can be made independent from the internet by storing it in the disk. With this method; “Still data” that does not need to be used actively, whose need is questioned, or which does not have time to be used even if it is important can be stored. In the blockchain ecosystem, wallets store crypto assets. There are two types of wallets, hot and cold. Crypto assets with constant investment movement can be kept safe with the hot storage method. In this way, the person can transact with his assets whenever he wishes. In addition to using hot wallets, holding assets on cryptocurrency exchanges is also a method. Assets that are not planned to have an investment circulation can be safely kept in a cold wallet. Since there is no need for internet access in this method, the possibility of being affected by cyber attacks is also minimized. Access can only be achieved by logging in with the specified password and that password should not be shared with third parties.

        <ul class="accordion-dropmenu">
            <p>
                Anti-money laundering (Anti Money Laundering or AML) refers to a set of laws, regulations and procedures aimed at preventing criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. While anti-money laundering laws cover a relatively limited number of transactions and criminal acts, their consequences are far-reaching. AML regulations are meant to ensure that banks and other financial institutions that issue loans or allow customers to open deposit accounts do not aid in money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws and regulations include criminal activities such as market manipulation, illegal trade in goods, corruption of public funds and tax evasion; It targets the methods used to hide these crimes and the money obtained from them. Criminals often strive to “launder” money they have obtained illegally through activities such as drug trafficking. One of the most common techniques is to run the money through a legitimate, cash-based business owned by a criminal organization or confederation. Money launderers can deposit cash in smaller increments that are unlikely to raise suspicion or be used to purchase other cash instruments. Or they deposit money using dishonest brokers who want to ignore the rules in exchange for large commissions. However, the AML holding period is enshrined in a rule that requires deposits to remain in an account for at least five trading days. This holding period is aimed at combating money laundering and assisting in risk management.

The practice of arbitrage involves buying and reselling assets for profit. In other words, it means taking advantage of the price difference between multiple markets. The term is most commonly applied to financial investment trading of assets such as bonds, stocks and derivatives. But it can also be applied to any situation that can match deals that take advantage of unstable market prices. Arbitrage is the result of market inefficiencies and helps ensure that prices do not deviate significantly from fair market values over an extended period of time. Persons or businesses dealing with arbitrage are called arbitrageurs. Arbitrages are usually banks or brokerage firms, but may also be other companies or individuals, depending on the situation.

                <p>
                    Bear season, or bear market, is when the market experiences prolonged price drops. It is often used to refer to situations where security prices have dropped 20% or more from recent highs due to widespread pessimism and negative investor sentiment. Bear seasons are often associated with dips in an overall market or index, such as the S&P 500; however, individual securities may be considered acceptable during a bear season if they are down 20% or more over an extended period of time. Although there is no general opinion about how long the bear season will last, it is expected that prices will continue to decrease for a long time. Demand for products in a bear market is decreasing. Since the demand has decreased, nobody wants to buy those products and the prices continue to fall. The causes of a bear market often vary, but in general, a weak, slowing or stagnant economy will bring with it a bear market. Signs of a weak or slowing economy are often hidden in low employment, low disposable income, weak productivity and business profits. Also, any government intervention in the economy can trigger a bear market. For example, changes in the tax rate or interest rates can lead to a bear market. Similarly, a drop in investor confidence could signal the beginning of a bear market. Investors will act when they believe something will happen; in which case they sell shares to avoid losses

                            There are two ways to store data in digital media: Cold and hot  storage. Hot wallet is used for easily accessible data; It is a fast and expensive type of storage. Cold wallet, on the other hand, is more economical and is a type of offline storage used for data that does not need continuous use. E.g; Storing files and data through various cloud applications is a storage method. Cloud systems can offer hot or cold services as needed. In which cases cold storage and in which cases hot storage will be preferred actually determines the data itself. All data that needs to be accessed continuously and that can be shared when necessary should be stored with hot storage method. By storing visual or written files in Google-based storage systems; The best example of this is to be able to download it quickly when necessary, to make various additions or changes on it, and even to share it. It may take minutes or even hours to access data or files stored with the cold storage method. Sometimes the data can be made independent from the internet by storing it in the disk. With this method; “Still data” that does not need to be used actively, whose need is questioned, or which does not have time to be used even if it is important can be stored. In the blockchain ecosystem, wallets store crypto assets. There are two types of wallets, hot and cold. Crypto assets with constant investment movement can be kept safe with the hot storage method. In this way, the person can transact with his assets whenever he wishes. In addition to using hot wallets, holding assets on cryptocurrency exchanges is also a method. Assets that are not planned to have an investment circulation can be safely kept in a cold wallet. Since there is no need for internet access in this method, the possibility of being affected by cyber attacks is also minimized. Access can only be achieved by logging in with the specified password and that password should not be shared with third parties.
